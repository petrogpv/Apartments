# Apartments
My most complex project - the web-application created for the business "Rent apartments by days". 
The application is based on Spring MVC, Spring Security, Hibernate, MySQL...
There is a user authentication - two categories of users: administrator and user. 
The administrator has more permits.

Features:
- Addition of apartments with photos
- Save types of tariffs for the month (three types of tariffs - usual, weekends, holidays)
- Preservation of price for each apartment on the types of tariffs .
- Automatic daily price check for relevance (archiving expired prices)
- Easily view the calendar of reservation (price per day, reserved or free)
- Reservation of vacant apartments in the calendar
-  Creation of orders for one or more apartments in the same warrant
- Addition new clients or searching for existing  in database to create order
- Search orders by clients
